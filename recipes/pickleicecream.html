    <h2>A tried and true recipe for a specific type of craving</h2>

    <p>Although it’s a classic pregnancy craving, you don’t have to be pregnant (or a woman) to groove on snacks that are both salty and sweet. In fact, we’re hard-wired to do so. Our brains crave variety!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup bread-and-butter pickles diced (about the size of pencil erasers)</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp vanilla paste or extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>PREPARATION Line a plate with parchment or wax paper and spread diced pickles across it in a single layer. Freeze until solid, at least one hour. In a medium saucepan, combine cream, milk, salt, sugar and egg yolks. Whisk to blend. Place over medium-low heat and whisk continuously, occasionally scraping the bottom of the pan with a rubber spatula, until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of the spatula, about 10 to 12 minutes. Pour mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a mixing bowl. Add vanilla, whisking until smooth. Cool custard by placing the bottom of the bowl into a bowl of ice water and stirring until chilled, about 20 minutes, or by refrigerating for 2 to 24 hours. Freeze the chilled custard in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer’s instructions. Just before ice cream is fully set and still churning, add diced frozen pickles. Transfer to a bowl, cover and freeze until firm.</li>
    </ol>
